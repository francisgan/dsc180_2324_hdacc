# dsc180_2324_hdacc
UCSD DSC180 23-24 Hardware accelarating in ML Group


Environment Requirement: Python 3.9 or higher

# Setup instruction:
enter /chakra, open Command, run follow code:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python setup.py install

# Data:

download dataset:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/231/pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring

unpack pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring.zip, then unpack PAMAP2_Dataset.zip

you can find all data files in /pamap2+physical+activity+monitoring/PAMAP2_Dataset/Protocol

put dat files in /data, modify variable path in python file


# Error Solution:

If you see "AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'xxx'"

Please modify all related source file as following:

change from: "from collections import xxx"

to           "from collections.abc import xxx"

# Files interpretation:

dnn_model.py shows code that training process of DNN based HAR code. The result is bad, since we didn't set good params and didn't train it on entire dataset, which will take large amount of time and require deeper PHD level knowledge. Since we only care about the efficiency on inferece process, this training code doesn't matter.

collect_trace.py shows code that collect trace on a inferece code. We simulate the inference process by passing a real data into untrained DNN model, the result label is NaN, but the trace similar to the trace on a trained model. And we collect traces on this process. The output files are pytorchET.json and kinetoET.json

Since Chakra and Astra-sim are still not fully developped, we are lookinf for a alternative way, such as use pytorch.profile library directly. In profiler_output.py, we are looking for some result generated by such library.

utility.py, trace_link.py and execution_trace.py are tools
